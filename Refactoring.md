# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In the refactored code, I focused on improving the readability and maintainability by following some principles of clean code, as outlined by Robert C. Martin. Here are the changes I made:

Separation of Concerns: I extracted the logic for determining the candidate partition key into a separate function called determineCandidate(). This function handles both cases where the event.partitionKey is defined and undefined, following the single responsibility principle. This separation makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

Isolation of Hashing Logic: I created a separate function called hashCandidate() to encapsulate the hashing logic. This function takes a candidate string and returns its hash. By isolating the hashing logic, the main function deterministicPartitionKey() remains focused on its primary responsibility, improving code readability and adhering to the principle of separation of concerns.

Removal of Unnecessary Code: I removed unnecessary if conditions and variable assignments to simplify the code. The typeof check for the candidate string is no longer needed because the determineCandidate() function handles it appropriately. Additionally, the assignment of TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY to candidate was eliminated since it is assigned at the end of the function if the candidate is still undefined.

Descriptive Naming: I used descriptive function and variable names to enhance code readability and make the code more self-explanatory. This follows the principle of clarity, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and functionality of each component.

By following these clean code principles, the refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original code while improving readability and maintainability. The modular structure, separation of concerns, and descriptive naming contribute to code that is easier to understand, modify, and maintain over time.
